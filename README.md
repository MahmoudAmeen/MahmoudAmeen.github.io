3- This website is a prototype for a non-profit organization for supporting the children of Haiti.
I made it using HTML,CSS,JS,w3.css and it's only a prototype which I made in less than 24 hours.

4- This website is a near-final product for the same non-profit org that I made the prototype for. 
I used WordPress CMS to build it and made a lot of customization to Azera shop theme which included making a custom post type
with custom metadata and custom page templates. 
these are some of the website functionality: 
1: ability to accept donations
2: you can sponsor a child and make a recurring donation for him/her. 
as well as some other features like an event manager, social media feed, and chat box (I'll add the chat box in after uploading the website
to its final hosting.)
Note: the website needs a lot of optimization and improvements and it still under construction.
