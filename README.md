this is a list of the websites I have built.

1- the first website here is about mobile app called Gamma App.<br>
I built it using HTML,CSS,Bootstrap.<br>

2- This website is a prototype for a non-profit organization for supporting the children of Haiti.<br>
I made it using HTML,CSS,JS,w3.css and it's only a prototype which I made in less than 24 hours. <br>

4- This website is a near-final product for the same non-profit org that I made the prototype for. <br>

I used WordPress CMS to build it and made a lot of customization to Azera shop theme which included making a custom post type
with custom metadata and custom page templates. <br>

these are some of the website functionality: <br>
1- ability to accept donations.<br>
2- you can sponsor a child and make a recurring donation for him/her.<br>
3- it have an event manager.
as well as some other features like an event manager, social media feed, and chat box (I'll add the chat box in after uploading the
website to its final hosting).<br>

Note: the website needs a lot of optimization and improvements and it still under construction.<br>
