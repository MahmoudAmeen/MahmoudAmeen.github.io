3- This website is a prototype for a non-profit organization for supporting the children of Haiti.<br>
I made it using HTML,CSS,JS,w3.css and it's only a prototype which I made in less than 24 hours. <br>
you can check it here:<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4- This website is a near-final product for the same non-profit org that I made the prototype for. <br>

I used WordPress CMS to build it and made a lot of customization to Azera shop theme which included making a custom post type
with custom metadata and custom page templates. <br>

these are some of the website functionality: <br>
1- ability to accept donations.<br>
2- you can sponsor a child and make a recurring donation for him/her.<br>

as well as some other features like an event manager, social media feed, and chat box (I'll add the chat box in after uploading the <br>
website to its final hosting).<br>

Note: the website needs a lot of optimization and improvements and it still under construction.<br>
